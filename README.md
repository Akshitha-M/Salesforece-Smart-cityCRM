🚮 Smart City Waste Management - Salesforce Project
📌 Overview

This project is a Salesforce-based Smart City Waste Management System.
It is designed to streamline citizen pickup requests, waste collection tracking, truck assignment, and recycling plant management.

The solution uses Salesforce declarative features (Objects, Record Types, Page Layouts, Validation Rules, Flows, Approval Process) along with Apex triggers, classes, and LWC components for automation and user-friendly interfaces.
Additionally, it integrates with Google Maps API to calculate distance and ETA between pickup locations and recycling plants.
