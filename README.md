# Smart City Waste Management

**Smart City Waste Management** is a Salesforce-based project designed to digitalize and automate the waste collection process.  
It allows **citizens** to submit pickup requests, **collectors** to manage trucks and tasks, and **city officials** to monitor all operations in real-time.  
The system uses **Apex, Flows, and Lightning Components**, and integrates with **Google Maps API** to calculate distance and ETA between citizen addresses and recycling plants, ensuring smarter and more efficient waste management.
